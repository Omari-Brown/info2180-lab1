			<p>I am currently in my third and final year of the University Of the West
Indies Mona Campus's B.Sc. Actuarial Science programme. In my free time I enjoy playing video games,
watching anime, listening to music and jogging. Technology and the internet has been and will continue to redefine 
our lives over the next several decades. I believe that Web Development will be an indispensible skill 
for individuals in both personal and corporate matters. As such I am excited to learn Web Development.</p>
